## Philosophy   
Science should be reproducible and one of the best ways to achieve this is by logging research activities in a notebook. Because science/biology has increasingly become computational, it is easier to document computational projects in an electronic form, which can be shared online through Github.    

### Helpful features of the notebook     

**It is absolutely critical for your future self and others to follow your work.**     

* The notebook is set up with a series of internal links from the table of contents.    
* All notebooks should have a table of contents which has the "Page", date, and title (information that allows the reader to understand your work).     
* Also, one of the perks of keeping all activities in a single document is that you can **search and find elements quickly**.     
* You can document anything you'd like, aside from logging your research activities. For example:
	* feel free to log all/any ideas for your research project([example](https://github.com/adnguyen/Notebooks_and_Protocols/blob/master/2016_notebook.md#page-39-2016-06-13-post-doc-project-idea-assessing-current-impacts-of-climate-change-in-natural-populations)) as an entry,     
	* or write down notes for a paper([example](https://github.com/adnguyen/Notebooks_and_Protocols/blob/master/2016_notebook.md#id-section36).      

* Lastly, you can share specific entries because of the three "#" automatically creates a link when the notebook renders on github.

### Page 1: 2016-07-18. Ecological genomics, first class

### **Steve and Melissa's intro**    
* Steve: It is a young field, trying to establish it's own identity    
	* Ecological genomics institute, KSU: emphasis on adaptation to environment   
	* Gordon Research Conference: Integrating different levels of biological organization on **ANY SYSTEM**; approach and tool focused! Field going towards new data and new analytic techniques  
	* Intro to eco genomics, oxford press; Using technology to address ecological issues such as nutrient cycling, population structure, life history vairation , trophic interaction, stress responess, and adpatation to environmental change   

* DATA driven: next gen sequencing revolutionizes biology
	* creats a new problem--large datasets!!! how to make sense? 
	* not data limited and potentially computationally limited   

* Where is the field headed    
	* Molecular Ecology Journal(flagship journal representative o the field)  
		* ALL systems:  corals, protists, daphnia, coral, lemurs, dandelions, steve studies trees 
		* model organism constraint disappearing!   
	* What types of questions are asked?  
		* How do genes correspond with circadian rythm?  
		* How does the microbiome influence the organism? 
		* How does epigenetic variation influence evolutionary responses? or contribute to phenotypic variation?  
		* What are the patterns of genetic diversity that can give us insights on population dynamics?  
		* What are constraints and tradeoffs and genetic mechanisms of traits? 

* Methods?   
	* De novo genome assembly; sequencing a DNA book from scratch!!    
		* RNA-seq; transcriptomic profiling     
	* 16 s metagenomic sequencing      
	* Rad-seq/GBS for estiamting population structure and genetic diversity     

* Proccesses studied?    
	* All evo and eco stuff; speciation, hybridization, local adaptation, genetic basis of local adaptation, genetic architecture of complex phenotypes, genes controlling host-pathogen evolutionary dynamics, pop structure, gene flow, epigenetics     
	
* Goals of the course!    
	1. Learn how ecology and genomes shape each other   
	2. Think creatively about major questions, and pose testable hypotheses to those questions using appropriate genomic data    
	3. Think about careful experimental design and statistical analysis---shown by reading papers   
	4. Achive working knowledge and level of comfort for bioinformatics routines for ecological genomics studies   
	
### Melissa background	  

**Background, what drove Melissa and Steve to ecological genomics?**       

Melissa read a cool paper that scales from analyzing a few loci to the whole genome.   

One figure popped out at her, FST (developed by Sewell Wright) histogram.   FST of 1= complete differentiation, FST of 0 = no diff. FST described as **Alleles in space**. From this histogram, Melissa was struck by how you can separate out neutral from selective ones.  

Melissa has a data set with 96 sea stars and then the 16s microbiome. Would be cool to see if there is heritability in some bactera

### Steve background   

* Inspired by Yanis Antonivics (an **OG**)   
* At the time, just so stories: **Adaptatationist programme**    
	* Just go out and go by feeling in a natural history way and prescribe an adaptation story   
	* Janis wrote a creed to quantify the operational relationship between traits, environment, and genetics     
* Yanis was on Steve's committee and Steve was interested in adaptation with respect to invasion biology because organisms need to respond to novel environments     
	* Phenotypes can relate to the environment, but what is the genetic basis of local adaptation (in situ)? There are other confounding issues: demographic effects, plasticity     
* Steve thinks about environment-phenotype-genetics triangle. Basically a path diagram that feeds back on each other.    
	* Relationship between genes and phenotype ---GWAS (Genome wide association study)    
	* Relationship between genetics and environment --- Fst, clines between allele frequencies and environment    
* Invasion history is tough because of demographic history    
* He decided to focus on trees; large population size, straddle huge environmental gradients so the opportunity for selection is high   
	* positive relationship between Growing season length and traits    
	* Did a  reciprocal transplant of different populations to identify the extent of local adaptation in large established common gardens    
	* SK does GBS (genotype by sequencing)      
	* Problem with field: validating key gene candidates
